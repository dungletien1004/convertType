-First, It took me approximately 30 minutes to read and complete the test. I feel that this test was relatively simple as it only involved converting data types

-In the "interfaces" folder, I write the code to save the interfaces that are shipped with the test

-In the folder "untils", I write the solution code of the test

    => function convertTimestamp used to convert Date -> TimeStamp
  
    => function convertToExtShoppingItems used to convert ShopingItemType -> ExtShopingItemType
  
    => function convertToExtNodeElements used to convert INodeElement -> IExtNodeElement
  
    => function convertToExtChat used to convert Chat -> ExtChat
  
-In the folder "mock", I write the mockdata of the test
